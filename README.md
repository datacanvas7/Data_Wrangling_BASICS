# Data_Wrangling_BASICS
This project demonstrates the fundamental steps of data wrangling using Python. It covers techniques to clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis or machine learning models.

## Steps Performed
- Gathering Data
Loaded datasets using libraries like pandas.

- Tools to Clean Data (Libraries)
`pandas` — data manipulation

`numpy` — numerical operations

`scipy` — statistical operations (e.g., z-score)

`matplotlib / seaborn` — visualization

- How to Clean Data (Steps)
Inspected data types, missing values, and summary statistics.

- Dealing with Missing Values
Used techniques like `dropping` missing records or filling them with `mean/median/mode`.

- Correcting Errors in Data
Fixed `inconsistent` data entries (e.g., typos, wrong formats).

- Outliers Removal
Identified and removed `outliers` using:

`IQR Method`

`Z-score Method`

- Visualization
Plotted `distributions`, `boxplots`, and `scatterplots` to spot issues.

- Dropping Duplicates
Removed `duplicate` rows to ensure data integrity.

- Transforming the Data
Applied `normalization` and `scaling` techniques:

`Min-Max Normalization/Scaling`

`Standard Scaling`

`Z-score Normalization`

`Decimal Scaling`

`Log Transformation`

`Winsorization`

- Feature Engineering
Created `new columns` and renamed existing ones for clarity.

- Organizing the Data
Final data structured into `clean columns`, saved to new files for downstream tasks.

- Saving the Wrangled Data
Exported the cleaned and transformed dataset using Python.
